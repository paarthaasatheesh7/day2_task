Difference between Document and Window Objects:

Document Object:
       The Document object represents the HTML document loaded in the browser. It serves as the entry point to the content of a webpage, allowing the users to manipulate and interact with the data in it. 

1. Hierarchy and Structure:
   - The Document object represents the entire HTML document, forming a hierarchical structure that includes elements like head, body, and their respective child elements.
   - Developers can access and manipulate individual elements using methods like getElementById.

2. Content Manipulation:
   - Document object enables content manipulation, allowing developers to dynamically create, modify, or delete elements within the document.
   - Methods like createElement, appendChild, and innerHTML facilitate the manipulation of document content.

3. CSS and Styling:
   - Developers can access and modify CSS styles associated with elements through the Document object using properties like style or classList.
   - CSS classes and styles can be added or removed dynamically.

Window Object:

The Window object, represents the browser window or tab containing the Document object. It acts as a global object and provides a platform for various functionalities related to the browser environment. Key characteristics of the Window object include:

1. Global Scope:
   - The Window object is global, meaning that variables and functions declared without a specific scope become properties and methods of the Window object.
   - It serves as the global context for JavaScript code running in a browser.

2. Browser Information:
   - The Window object provides information about the browser environment, including properties like innerWidth, innerHeight, and location.
   - Methods like alert and confirm are also part of the Window object, offering interaction with users.

3. Timers and Events:
   - Functions like setTimeout and setInterval for scheduling code execution are part of the Window object.
   - Event handling, such as addEventListener, is used to capture and respond to user interactions within the browser.

In simple words, the Document object represents the content and structure of an HTML document whereas the Window object is the browser environment and provides functionalities beyond the document.
